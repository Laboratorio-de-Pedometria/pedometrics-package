#' Pedometric Tools and Techniques
#' 
#' This package contains many tools and techniques used in the field of 
#' pedometrics (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometrics for a definition 
#' of \emph{pedometrics}). These tools and techniques were developed to fulfil 
#' the demands created by the PhD research project (2012-2016) entitled
#' \dQuote{Contribution to the Construction of Models for Predicting Soil
#' Properties}, developed by Alessandro Samuel-Rosa under the supervision of 
#' Dr Lúcia HC Anjos (Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), 
#' Dr Gustavo M Vasques (Embrapa Solos, Brazil), and Dr Gerard B M Heuvelink
#' (ISRIC - World Soil Information, the Netherlands). The project is/was
#' funded by the CNPq Foundation (Process 140720/2012-0), Ministry of Science 
#' and Technology of Brazil, Brasília, DF, 70040-020, Brazil, phone +55 (61) 
#' 2022 6002, and the CAPES Foundation (Process ID BEX 11677/13-9), Ministry of 
#' Education of Brazil, Brasília, DF, 70040-020, Brazil, phone: +55 (61) 2022
#' 6210.
#' 
#' Several functions simply extend the functionalities of other functions
#' commonly used for the analysis of pedometric data. It should be noted that
#' changes are likely to occur quite often and the use of this package as a 
#' dependency for other packages is strongly discouraged.
