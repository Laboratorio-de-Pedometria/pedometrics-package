#' 
#' @details There are five methods two guess the initial covariance parameters
#' (ICP). Two of them (\code{"a"} and \code{"b"}) rely a sample variogram with
#' exponentially spaced lag-distance classes, while the other three (\code{"b"},
#' \code{"d"}, and \code{"e"}) use equidistant lag-distance classes (see
#' \code{\link[pedometrics]{vgmLags}}). All of them are 
#' \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic}{heuristic}.
#' 
#' Method \code{"a"} was developed in-house, and is the most elaborated of them,
#' specially for guessing the nugget variance. Method \code{"c"} is implemented 
#' in the \pkg{automap}-package and was developed by 
#' \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2008.10.011}{Hiemstra et al. (2009)}.
#' 
#' Method \code{"b"} was proposed by 
#' \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0098-3004(95)00095-X}{Jian et al. (1996)} and
#' is implemented in \href{https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_variogram_a0000000593.htm}{SAS/STAT(R) 9.22}.
#' Method \code{"d"} was developed by 
#' \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11004-012-9434-1}{Desassis & Renard (2012)}.
#' Method \code{"e"} was proposed by 
#' \href{http://www.ccgalberta.com/ccgresources/report05/2003-122-varfit.pdf}{Larrondo et al. (2003)} and is implemented in the VARFIT module of

    # RANGE
    # In general, the initial guess for the range (scale) parameter is made 
    # based on the lag-distance classes and on the dimensions of the study area.
    # The most common rule is to compute the initial range as half the 
    # maximum distance up to which lag-distance classes have been defined 
    # (Jian et al., 1996; Larrondo et al., 2003; Desassis & Renard, 2012). 
    # Others set the initial range to a proportion of the diagonal of the study 
    # area, say 0.1, 0.35 or 0.5 (Hiemstra et al., 2009).
    # I think that this rather arbitrary and, possibly, suboptimal because the 
    # lag-distance classes usually are defined by some automatic procedure
    # implemented in the software being used, which does not account for the
    # features of the data that is being analysed.
    # I propose using the estimate of the variance and semivariance of the data
    # to make an initial guess for the range parameter. The variance is used
    # here because it is the initial guess of the total sill (see bellow).
    # I start computing the absolute difference between the semivariogram and 
    # the variance in each lag-distance class (except for the first). Then, I
    # record the index of the lag-distance class where the semivariance is 
    # closest to the variance. The separation distance at the centre of this 
    # lag-distance class is used as the initial guess for the range parameter.
