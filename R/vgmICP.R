#' Guess the parameters of a spatial covariance function
#'
#' @description
#' Guess the parameters of the spatial covariance function of a random, regionalized variable. A
#' guess of such parameters is required to start the fitting functions of many geostatistical
#' packages such as __gstat__, __geoR__, and __georob__.
#'
#' @inheritParams variogramBins
#'
#' @param z Numeric vector with the values of the regionalized variable for which the values for the
#' spatial covariance parameters should be guessed.
#'
#' @param lags Numeric scalar defining the width of the variogram bins or a numeric vector with the
#' lower and upper bounds of the variogram bins. If missing, the variogram bins are computed using
#' [pedometrics::variogramBins()]. See \sQuote{Details} for more information.
#'
#' @param method Character keyword defining the method used for guessing the spatial covariance
#' parameters of the regionalized variable. Defaults to `method = "a"`. See \sQuote{Details} for
#' more information.
#'
#' @param min.npairs Positive integer defining the minimum number of point-pairs required so that a
#' variogram bin is used to guessing the spatial covariance parameters of the  of the regionalized
#' variable. Defaults to `min.npairs = 30`.
#'
#' @param model Character keyword defining the spatial covariance function that will be fitted to
#' the data of the regionalized variable. Currently, most of the basic spatial covariance function
#' are accepted. See `geoR::cov.spatial()` for more information. Defaults to `model = "matern"`.
#'
#' @param nu Numerical value for the additional smoothness parameter \eqn{\nu} of the spatial
#' covariance function of the regionalized variable. See `RandomFields::RMmodel()` and argument
#' `kappa` of `geoR::cov.spatial()` for more information.
#'
#' @param plotit Should the guessed spatial covariance parameters be plotted along with the sample
#' (experimental) variogram of the regionalized variable? Defaults to `plotit = FALSE`.
#'
#' @param estimator Character keyword defining the estimator for computing the sample (experimental)
#' variogram of the regionalized variable, with options `"qn"` (default), `"mad"`, `"matheron"`, and
#' `"ch"`. See `georob::sample.variogram()` for more details.
#'
#' @return
#' A vector of numerical values, the guesses for the spatial covariance parameters of the
#' regionalized variable:
#' 
#'   * nugget
#'   * partial sill
#'   * range
#'
#' @details
#' There are five methods two guess the covariance parameters. Two of them, `"a"` and `"c"`, rely on
#' a sample variogram with exponentially growing variogram bins, while the other three, `"b"`,
#' `"d"`, and `"e"`, use equal-width variogram bins (see [pedometrics::variogramBins()]). All of
#' them are [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic).
#'
#' Method `"a"` was developed in-house and is the most elaborated of them, specially for guessing
#' the nugget variance.
#'
#' Method `"b"` was proposed by \doi{10.1016/0098-3004(95)00095-X}{Jian et al. (1996)} and
#' is implemented in \href{https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_variogram_a0000000593.htm}{SAS/STAT(R) 9.22}.
#'
#' Method `"c"` is implemented in the __automap__-package and was developed by
#' \doi{10.1016/j.cageo.2008.10.011}{Hiemstra et al. (2009)}.
#'
#' Method `"d"` was developed by \doi{10.1007/s11004-012-9434-1}{Desassis & Renard (2012)}.
#'
#' Method `"e"` was proposed by Larrondo et al. (2003)
#' <http://www.ccgalberta.com/ccgresources/report05/2003-122-varfit.pdf> and is implemented in the
#' VARFIT module of GSLIB <http://www.gslib.com/>.

    # RANGE ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # In general, the initial guess for the range (scale) parameter is made based on the lag-distance classes
    # and on the dimensions of the study area. A common rule is to compute the initial range as half the 
    # maximum distance up to which lag-distance classes have been defined (Jian et al., 1996; Larrondo et al.,
    # 2003; Desassis & Renard, 2012). Others set the initial range to a proportion of the diagonal of the study
    # area, say 0.1, 0.35 or 0.5 (Hiemstra et al., 2009). This is rather arbitrary: the lag-distance classes
    # usually are defined by some automatic procedure implemented in the software being used, which does not
    # account for the features of the data that is being analysed.
    # I propose using the estimate of the total variance and semivariance of the variable to make an initial
    # guess for the range parameter. The total variance is used here because it is the initial guess of the
    # total sill (see bellow).
    # I start computing the absolute difference between the total variance and the semivariogram in each 
    # lag-distance class (except for the first). Then, I record the index of the lag-distance class where the
    # semivariance is closest to the variance. The separation distance at the centre of this lag-distance class
    # is recorded. This value can be taken to be approximately equivalent to the practical range. Thus, it is
    # corrected using geoR::practicalRange.
