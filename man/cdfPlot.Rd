\arguments{
\item{obj}{Object with the estimated CDF. The resulting object of
\code{cont.analysis()} of \pkg{spsurvey}-package.}

\item{ind}{Indicator variable. The name of the variable as displayed in the
resulting object of \code{cont.analysis()}.}

\item{units.cdf}{Indicator for the type of units in which the CDF is
plotted, where \dQuote{percent} means the plot is in terms of percent of the
population, and \dQuote{units} means the plot is in terms of units of the
population.  Defaults to \code{units.cdf = "percent"}.}

\item{type.plot}{Type of plot. Desired type of plot to be produced, with
options \code{type.plot = "l"}, for \sQuote{line}, and \code{type.plot =
"s"} for \sQuote{stair}. See \sQuote{Details}. Defaults to \code{type.plot =
"s"}.}

\item{type.cdf}{Character string consisting of the value \dQuote{continuous}
or \dQuote{ordinal} that controls the type of CDF plot for each indicator.
Defaults to \code{type.cdf = "continuous"}.}

\item{logx}{Character string consisting of the value \code{""} or \code{"x"}
that controls whether the x axis uses the original scale (\code{""}) or the
base 10 logarithmic scale (\code{"x"}). Defaults to \code{logx = ""}.}

\item{xlbl}{Character string providing the x-axis label. If this argument
equals \code{NULL}, then the indicator name is used as the label. Defaults
to \code{xlbl = NULL}.}

\item{ylbl}{Character string providing the the y-axis label. Defaults to
\code{ylbl = "Percent"}.}

\item{ylbl.r}{Character string providing the label for the right side
y-axis, where \code{ylbl.r = NULL} means a label is not created, and
\code{ylbl.r = "Same"} means the label is the same as the left side label
(i.e., argument \code{ylbl}). Defaults to \code{ylbl.r = NULL}.}

\item{figlab}{Character string providing the plot title. Defaults to
\code{figlab = NULL}.}

\item{legloc}{Indicator for location of the plot legend, where \code{legloc
= "BR"} means bottom right, \code{legloc = "BL"} means bottom left,
\code{legloc = "TR"} means top right, and \code{legloc = "TL"} means top
left. Defaults to \code{legloc = "BR"}.}

\item{confcut}{Numeric value that controls plotting confidence limits at the
CDF extremes. Confidence limits for CDF values (percent scale) less than
\code{confcut} or greater than 100 minus \code{confcut} are not plotted.  A
value of zero means confidence limits are plotted for the complete range of
the CDF. Defaults to \code{confcut = 5}.}

\item{show.conflev}{Logical for showing the confidence limits of the CDF.
Defaults to \code{show.conflev = TRUE}.}

\item{conflev}{Numeric value of the confidence level used for confidence
limits. Defaults to \code{conflev = 95}.}

\item{show.param}{Logical for showing the parameters of the CDF. Available
parameters are the mean, the median, and a percentile defined by the
argument \code{conflev}.  The legend displays de actual values of all three
parameters, including the standard deviation of the mean. The percentile
value is calculated using \code{spsurvey::interp.cdf()}.}

\item{round}{Numeric to set the rounding level of the parameters of the CDF.}

\item{col.param}{Color of the lines showing the parameters of the CDF.
Defaults to \code{col.param = "black"}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{plot()}. See
\sQuote{Details}.}
}
\value{
A plot of the estimated cumulative distribution function with
confidence limits.

\description{
This function is a modified version of \code{cdf.plot()} of
\pkg{spsurvey}-package including new argument options.
}
\details{
Parameter \code{type.plot} is used only when \code{type.cdf = "Continuous"}.

Care should be taken with possible conflicts between the arguments of the
original function \code{\link[spsurvey]{cdf.plot}} and those passed to
\code{plot()} using \code{...}. The existence of conflicts between these two
functions was one of the reasons for creating this new implementation.
}
\note{
Most of the source code that constitutes this function was originally
published in the \pkg{spsurvey}-package, version 2.6 (2013-09-20). The
authors were asked to include a few new functionalities, but did not seem to
be interested in doing so, since no reply was obtained. This implementation
is a way of including such functionalities. When using this function, credit
should be given to the authors of the original implementation in the
\pkg{spsurvey}-package.

## Estimate the CDF

## See indicator levels in the resulting object
levels(my.cdf$Pct$Indicator)

## Plot CDF
