# Pedometric Tools and Techniques

This R-package contains functions to employ many tools and
techniques used in the field of [pedometrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometrics). 
These functions were developed to fulfil the demands created by the PhD
research project (2012-2016) entitled Contribution to the Construction of
Models for Predicting Soil Properties, developed by Alessandro Samuel-Rosa
under the supervision of Dr Lucia HC Anjos (Universidade Federal Rural do
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), Dr Gustavo M Vasques (Embrapa Solos, Brazil), and
Dr Gerard BM Heuvelink (ISRIC - World Soil Information, the Netherlands).
The project is supported by the CAPES, Ministério da Educação, Brasília -
DF 70040-020, Brazil, process ID BEX 11677/13-9. Several functions are
simple wrapper functions that extend the functionalities of other functions
commonly used for the analysis of pedometric data. It should be noted that
changes are likely to occur quite often and using this package as a
dependency for other packages is strongly discouraged.

# How to collaborate

We use the *fork & pull* collaborative development model. This means that anyone can fork the `pedometrics` 
repository and push changes to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source 
`pedometrics` repository. The changes will be reviewed and, if pertinent, will be pulled into the source
`pedometrics` repository by the project maintainers.

We use the *fork & pull* collaborative development model mainly because it reduces the amount of friction for
new contributors. It makes it easier for others to contribute. Besides, it is very popular with open source
projects because it allows people to work independently without upfront coordination. Visit
https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ for more details on how to fork a repository and make
pull requests.
