# Pedometric Tools and Techniques

This R-package contains functions to employ many tools and
techniques used in the field of [pedometrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometrics). 
These functions were developed to fulfil the demands created by the PhD
research project (2012-2016) entitled Contribution to the Construction of
Models for Predicting Soil Properties, developed by Alessandro Samuel-Rosa
under the supervision of Dr Lucia HC Anjos (Universidade Federal Rural do
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), Dr Gustavo M Vasques (Embrapa Solos, Brazil), and
Dr Gerard BM Heuvelink (ISRIC - World Soil Information, the Netherlands).
The project is supported by the CAPES, Ministério da Educação, Brasília -
DF 70040-020, Brazil, process ID BEX 11677/13-9. Several functions are
simple wrapper functions that extend the functionalities of other functions
commonly used for the analysis of pedometric data. It should be noted that
changes are likely to occur quite often and using this package as a
dependency for other packages is strongly discouraged.
